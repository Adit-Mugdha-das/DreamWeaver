================================================================================
1. SAMPLE & SEGMENTATION
================================================================================
N (users) = 147
User segments:
  Drop-off: 41 users (27.9%)
  Moderate: 59 users (40.1%)
  High Engagement: 47 users (32.0%)

Retention:
  Retained / Active at Week 2: 69.4%

📌 PAPER SENTENCE:
"Our final behavioral dataset comprised 147 users, categorized as drop-off 
(n = 41), moderately engaged (n = 59), and highly engaged (n = 47). Overall, 
69.4% of users were still active by Week 2, indicating relatively strong 
retention for a two-week, app-based study."

using a mean of 9.65 features (SD = 5.85), attempting 4.35 riddles (SD = 3.64), 
and spending an average of 33.43 minutes per session (SD = 18.93). The composite 
engagement index averaged 39.84 (SD = 27.56) on a 0–100 scale, indicating a broad 
spread from very light to very intensive users."

3. EVOLUTION & HEALTH SCORES
================================================================================
Evolution_Score_Day1:
  Mean = 40.56, SD = 8.39

Evolution_Score (final):
  Mean = 48.06, SD = 28.32

Evolution_Score_Change:
  Mean = 7.50, SD = 21.16

Health_Score_Day1:
  Mean = 41.71, SD = 9.49

Health_Score (final):
  Mean = 50.48, SD = 30.09

Health_Score_Change:
  Mean = 8.77, SD = 21.91

📌 PAPER SENTENCE:
"Across all users, both evolution and health indices showed a positive average 
trajectory over the study period, with mean Evolution_Score increasing from 
40.56 to 48.06 (ΔM = +7.50, SD = 21.16) and Health_Score increasing from 
41.71 to 50.48 (ΔM = +8.77, SD = 21.91)."

================================================================================
4. SEGMENT-LEVEL DIFFERENCES
================================================================================
Engagement_Index by segment:
  Drop-off: M = 7.61
  Moderate: M = 35.92
  High Engagement: M = 72.87

Total_Dreams by segment:
  Drop-off: M = 1.88
  Moderate: M = 5.54
  High Engagement: M = 10.72

Evolution_Score_Change by segment:
  Drop-off: M = -21.85
  Moderate: M = 12.25
  High Engagement: M = 27.15

Health_Score_Change by segment:
  Drop-off: M = -22.51
  Moderate: M = 14.46
  High Engagement: M = 28.91

📌 PAPER SENTENCE:
"As expected, engagement differed markedly across user segments. The engagement 
index was lowest among drop-off users (M = 7.61), intermediate among moderate 
users (M = 35.92), and highest among highly engaged users (M = 72.87). Evolution 
and health change scores followed the same pattern, with high-engagement users 
showing the largest positive changes (Evolution: M = 27.15; Health: M = 28.91), 
moderate users showing moderate gains (Evolution: M = 12.25; Health: M = 14.46), 
and drop-off users showing negative changes (Evolution: M = -21.85; Health: M = -22.51)."

5. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN BEHAVIOR & OUTCOMES
================================================================================

5A. CORRELATIONS WITH ENGAGEMENT_INDEX:
Total_Dreams: r = 0.982
Active_Days: r = 0.981
Dreams_With_Emotions: r = 0.992
Dreams_With_Story: r = 0.817
Totems_Collected: r = 0.985
Riddles_Attempted: r = 0.988
Riddles_Solved: r = 0.949
Avg_Session_Minutes: r = 0.965
Total_Logins: r = 0.976
Features_Used_Count: r = 0.962
Evolution_Score: r = 0.928
Health_Score: r = 0.931
Evolution_Score_Change: r = 0.884
Health_Score_Change: r = 0.887

📌 PAPER SENTENCE:
"The engagement index was strongly and positively correlated with almost all 
behavioral metrics. Users with higher engagement submitted more dreams (r = .98), 
explored more features (r = .96), solved more riddles (r = .95), spent longer in 
sessions (r = .97), and logged in more frequently (r = .98). Engagement was also 
positively correlated with final evolution and health scores (r = .93 for both) 
and their changes over time (r = .88 and r = .89, respectively), suggesting that 
deeper interaction with DreamWeaver is associated with stronger positive evolution 
in the dream DNA and health-related indices."

5B. CORRELATIONS WITH EVOLUTION_SCORE_CHANGE:
Health_Score_Change: r = 0.969
Features_Used_Count: r = 0.931
Avg_Session_Minutes: r = 0.919
Active_Days: r = 0.920
Totems_Collected: r = 0.904

📌 PAPER SENTENCE:
"Change in Evolution_Score was strongly associated with Health_Score_Change 
(r = .97) and a wide range of engagement features, including features used 
(r = .93), time spent (r = .92), active days (r = .92), and totems collected 
(r = .90). This indicates that the more users engaged with interactive elements 
such as totems and story-based interpretations, the more their dream DNA evolved 
in a positive direction."

6. ANOVA: ENGAGEMENT_INDEX BY SEGMENT
================================================================================
One-way ANOVA:
  F(2, 144) = 422.74
  p < .001

Group means:
  Drop-off: M = 7.61
  Moderate: M = 35.92
  High Engagement: M = 72.87

📌 PAPER SENTENCE:
"A one-way ANOVA revealed a strong effect of user segment on engagement 
(F(2,144) = 422.74, p < .001). Highly engaged users (M = 72.87) showed 
significantly higher engagement scores than both moderate users (M = 35.92) 
and drop-off users (M = 7.61), with moderate users also significantly more 
engaged than drop-off users."
