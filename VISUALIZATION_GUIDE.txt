For a standard 8-10 page journal article, include:

MUST INCLUDE (4-5 charts):
✅ Chart 2: Engagement by Segment (Box Plot) → Shows ANOVA result

✅ Chart 5: Retention Funnel → User journey
✅ Chart 9: Scatter Plot (Engagement vs Evolution) → Core hypothesis

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (pick 2):
✅ Chart 1: Sample Composition (for Methods section)
✅ Chart 7: Personality-Based Session Time → Unique insight

OPTIONAL (if Discussion section needs visuals):
✅ Chart 6: Riddle Difficulty → "Hard Fun" hypothesis
✅ Chart 8: Radar Chart → Comprehensive comparison

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
================================================================================

STEP 1: Create Essential Charts (Charts 2, 3, 4, 5, 9)
STEP 2: Generate high-resolution PNG files (300 DPI for publication)
STEP 3: Create versions with proper academic styling:
  - Sans-serif fonts (Arial, Helvetica)
  - Colorblind-friendly palettes
  - Clear legends and axis labels
  - APA/IEEE figure captions

STEP 4: Place charts in paper sections:
  - Methods: Chart 1 (sample composition)
  - Results: Charts 2, 3, 4, 9 (main findings)
  - Results/Discussion: Chart 5, 6, 7, 8 (journey & patterns)

================================================================================
READY TO START?
================================================================================

I can generate Python code for any of these charts. Just tell me which ones 
you want to create first. I recommend starting with:

1. Chart 2 (Engagement Box Plot) - easiest and most impactful
2. Chart 3 (Score Changes) - supports main hypothesis
3. Chart 4 (Correlation Heatmap) - shows ecosystem effect

Let me know which charts you'd like me to create!
