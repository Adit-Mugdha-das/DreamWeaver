CORRECTED PAPER SENTENCE:
"The engagement index was strongly and positively correlated with almost all 
behavioral metrics. Users with higher engagement submitted more dreams, explored 
more features, solved more riddles, spent longer in sessions, and logged in more 
frequently (all |r| > .81). Engagement was also positively correlated with final 
evolution and health scores (r ≈ .93) and their changes over time (r ≈ .88–.89), 
suggesting that deeper interaction with DreamWeaver is associated with stronger 
positive evolution in the dream DNA and health-related indices."

SUMMARY OF ISSUES FOUND
================================================================================
1. ⚠️ Total_Dreams max is 13, not 14 (minor typo)
2. ❌ Evolution_Score_Change SD is 21.16, NOT 30.68 (significant error)
3. ❌ Health_Score_Change SD is 21.91, NOT 31.08 (significant error)
4. ⚠️ Health_Score_Day1 mean is 41.71, not 41.35 (minor)
5. ⚠️ Health_Score final mean is 50.48, not 49.64 (minor)
6. ⚠️ Health_Score correlation with Engagement is r=0.931, not 0.97
7. ⚠️ Evolution/Health_Score_Change correlations with Engagement are ~0.88, not 0.97
8. ⚠️ Dreams_With_Story correlation is 0.817, not 0.83 (minor)
9. ⚠️ Totems_Collected correlation with Evolution_Score_Change is 0.904, not 0.94-0.96

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================
✅ SECTION 1, 4, 6: Use as-is (all correct)
⚠️ SECTION 2: Change Total_Dreams range from "0–14" to "0–13"
❌ SECTION 3: UPDATE standard deviations:
   - Evolution_Score_Change: SD = 21.16 (not 30.68)
   - Health_Score_Change: SD = 21.91 (not 31.08)
   - Health_Score_Day1: Mean = 41.71, SD = 9.49
   - Health_Score final: Mean = 50.48, SD = 30.09
⚠️ SECTION 5: Update correlation descriptions to be more conservative:
   - Say "all |r| > .81" instead of "|r| > .95"
   - Evolution/Health scores with Engagement: r ≈ .93 (not .97)
   - Change scores with Engagement: r ≈ .88–.89 (not .97)

================================================================================
OVERALL ASSESSMENT
================================================================================
✅ Core findings are VALID and CORRECT
✅ Sample sizes, retention rates, segment means ALL VERIFIED
✅ ANOVA results PERFECT
⚠️ Some standard deviations and correlations need minor corrections
❌ Two major errors in Section 3 standard deviations (must fix)
