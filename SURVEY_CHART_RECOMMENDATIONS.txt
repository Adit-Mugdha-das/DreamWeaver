PRIORITY ORDER FOR CREATING NEW SURVEY CHARTS
================================================================================

🏆 CREATE FIRST (Core findings):
1. CHART A: Pre-Post Likert Comparison → Validates expectations met
2. CHART C: Feature Preferences → Shows what drove engagement
3. CHART B: Satisfaction Heatmap → Overall experience quality

🥈 CREATE SECOND (Supporting evidence):

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS FROM SURVEY DATA INTEGRATION
================================================================================

**What survey data adds that usage data doesn't show:**

1. **Subjective Experience:**
   - Usage data shows WHAT users did
   - Survey data shows HOW they FELT about it
   - Both together = complete picture

2. **Expectation Validation:**
   - Pre-survey captures initial expectations
   - Post-survey shows if product met/exceeded them
   - Gap analysis shows DreamWeaver's impact

3. **Feature Value Perception:**
   - Usage data: Features_Used_Count (quantity)
   - Survey data: Most_Used_Feature (quality/preference)
   - Together: Which features drive both use AND satisfaction

4. **Retention Intent vs Actual:**
   - Usage data: Actual retention (69.4%)
   - Survey data: Willingness to continue/recommend
   - Validates sustainable engagement

5. **Qualitative Context:**
   - Improvement_Suggestion provides themes for Discussion
   - Hopes/Comments from pre-survey show initial motivations
   - Contextualizes quantitative findings


================================================================================
STATISTICAL TESTS TO RUN FOR SURVEY CHARTS
================================================================================

**For CHART A (Pre-Post Comparison):**
- Paired t-test (if same participants) OR Independent t-test
- Report: t(df), p-value, Cohen's d effect size
- Hypothesis: Post-survey ratings > Pre-survey expectations

**For CHART B (Satisfaction Heatmap):**
- Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, % at each level)
- Cronbach's alpha if treating as satisfaction scale
- Chi-square test for distribution differences

**For CHART C (Feature Preferences):**
- Frequency counts and percentages
- Chi-square goodness-of-fit test
- Cross-tabulation with user segments (Drop-off vs High)

**For CHART D (Retention Intention):**
- Percentage breakdown
- Chi-square test for independence
- Odds ratio: Continue_Using vs Recommend

**For CHART E (Usage vs Satisfaction):**
- Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric) or ANOVA
- Post-hoc pairwise comparisons
- Correlation: Days_Used (ordinal) vs Satisfaction (ordinal)


================================================================================
SAMPLE PAPER TEXT WITH SURVEY INTEGRATION
================================================================================

**Results section:**
"User satisfaction across five dimensions showed consistently high ratings 
(Figure 10), with Overall Enjoyment (M=4.3, SD=0.7) and Easy_to_Use (M=4.5, 
SD=0.6) receiving the highest scores among 86 respondents. Importantly, 
post-study ratings significantly exceeded pre-study expectations across all 
measured dimensions (Figure 9). Users' perceptions of Dream DNA's helpfulness 
increased from M=3.2 (pre-study) to M=4.3 (post-study), t(85)=6.24, p<.001, 
d=0.89, indicating that DreamWeaver not only met but exceeded initial 
expectations."

**Discussion section:**
"Feature preference analysis (Figure 12) revealed that Dream DNA (32%) and 
Story Mode (28%) were most valued by users, aligning with our behavioral data 
showing that these features predicted retention (Chart 11). Notably, 78% of 
users expressed willingness to continue using DreamWeaver beyond the study 
period (Figure 15), and 65% would recommend it to others, validating the 
platform's entertainment value beyond novelty effects."


================================================================================

4. CHART B: Satisfaction Heatmap
5. CHART D: Retention Intention

✅ **CREATE IF SPACE ALLOWS:**
6. CHART E: Usage vs Satisfaction
