using a mean of 9.65 features (SD = 5.85), attempting 4.35 riddles (SD = 3.64), 
and spending an average of 33.43 minutes per session (SD = 18.93). The composite

YOUR VERSION (ORIGINAL):
------------------------
Engagement_Index (core measure):
  Drop-off: 7.61
  Moderate: 35.92
  High Engagement: 72.87

Total_Dreams (mean):
  Drop-off: 2-ish (exact from earlier file, now slightly shifted but similar)
  Moderate: mid-range (~5–6)
  High Engagement: high (~10+)

Evolution_Score_Change (mean):
  Drop-off: strongly negative or small (from earlier: around –20)
  Moderate: moderately positive
  High Engagement: strongly positive

Health_Score_Change (mean):
  Similar pattern: drop-off ≈ negative, moderate ≈ +15, high ≈ +25+

VERIFIED VERSION (EXACT VALUES):
--------------------------------
Engagement_Index:
  Drop-off: M = 7.61 ✅
  Moderate: M = 35.92 ✅
  High Engagement: M = 72.87 ✅

  High Engagement: M = 10.72 ✅

Evolution_Score_Change:

  High Engagement: M = 27.15 ✅

Health_Score_Change:
  Drop-off: M = -22.51 ✅
  Moderate: M = 14.46 ✅ (very close to your "+15")

📌 PAPER SENTENCE (USE AS-IS):
"As expected, engagement differed markedly across user segments. The engagement 
index was lowest among drop-off users (M = 7.61), intermediate among moderate 
users (M = 35.92), and highest among highly engaged users (M = 72.87). Evolution 
and health change scores followed the same pattern, with high-engagement users 
showing the largest positive changes (Evolution: M = 27.15; Health: M = 28.91), 
moderate users showing moderate gains (Evolution: M = 12.25; Health: M = 14.46), 
and drop-off users showing negative changes (Evolution: M = -21.85; Health: M = -22.51)."

📌 PAPER SENTENCE (CORRECTED):
"The engagement index was strongly and positively correlated with almost all 
behavioral metrics. Users with higher engagement submitted more dreams (r = .98), 
explored more features (r = .96), solved more riddles (r = .95), spent longer in 
sessions (r = .97), and logged in more frequently (r = .98). Engagement was also 
positively correlated with final evolution and health scores (r = .93 and r = .93, 
respectively) and their changes over time (r = .88 for both), suggesting that 
deeper interaction with DreamWeaver is associated with stronger positive evolution 
in the dream DNA and health-related indices."

Alternative (more conservative):
"The engagement index was strongly and positively correlated with almost all 
behavioral metrics (all |r| > .81). Users with higher engagement demonstrated 
greater activity across all features, including dream submission, feature 
exploration, riddle solving, session duration, and login frequency. Engagement 
was also positively associated with both final scores (Evolution: r = .93; 
Health: r = .93) and positive changes over time (Evolution Change: r = .88; 
Health Change: r = .89)."

📌 SECOND PAPER SENTENCE (CORRECTED):
"Change in Evolution_Score was strongly associated with Health_Score_Change 
(r = .97) and a wide range of engagement features, including features used 
(r = .93), time spent (r = .92), active days (r = .92), and totems collected 
(r = .90). This indicates that the more users engaged with interactive elements 
such as totems and story-based interpretations, the more their dream DNA evolved 
in a positive direction."

significantly higher engagement scores than both moderate users (M = 35.92)

engaged than drop-off users."
