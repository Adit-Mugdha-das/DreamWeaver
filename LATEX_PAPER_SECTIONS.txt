\begin{abstract}
Dream journaling has demonstrated therapeutic potential for mental wellness, yet traditional approaches suffer from low adherence rates due to lack of immediate feedback and sustained motivation. We developed DreamWeaver, a mobile application that integrates gamification principles with dream journaling through interactive features including Dream DNA analysis, branching narrative storytelling, riddle challenges, and collectible totems. A 14-day user study with 147 participants tracked behavioral engagement across 11 features, complemented by pre-survey data (N=167) measuring initial expectations and post-survey data (N=86) assessing satisfaction and psychological outcomes. Participants were segmented into three engagement groups (Drop-off, Moderate, High) based on usage patterns, with daily Evolution and Health scores tracking mental wellness changes. High-engagement users (n=47) demonstrated significant improvements in Evolution scores (M=+27.15, SD=4.72) compared to drop-off users (M=-21.85, SD=13.20), F(2,144)=422.74, p<.001, $\eta^2$=.85, representing a 49-point difference in mental wellness outcomes. Overall retention reached 69.4\% over 14 days, with strong correlations between engagement and outcomes (r=.884 for Engagement-Evolution, r=.932 for Features-Health). Post-survey satisfaction was high (M=3.92/5), with 68.6\% of ratings at 4 or above, and 84.9\% of users expressing intent to continue. Users particularly valued Dream DNA analysis (16.3\%), Dream Art creation (14.0\%), and Riddle challenges (12.8\%), with harder riddles associated with 100\% retention compared to 0\% for users avoiding challenges. These findings demonstrate that gamification and entertainment computing principles can significantly enhance dream journaling engagement and mental wellness outcomes, transforming therapeutic self-reflection into an engaging, sustained practice with measurable psychological benefits.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Mental health challenges affect over 1 billion people worldwide, with anxiety and depression rates continuing to rise, particularly among young adults \citep{WHO2023}. Traditional therapeutic approaches, while effective, face barriers of accessibility, cost, and stigma. Digital mental health interventions offer promising alternatives, providing scalable, accessible tools for self-reflection and emotional regulation. Among these approaches, dream journaling has shown particular potential—dreams offer rich insights into emotional states, unresolved conflicts, and subconscious concerns, making them valuable material for self-exploration and psychological growth \citep{Schredl2010}.

However, traditional dream journaling suffers from a critical limitation: poor long-term adherence. Most users abandon the practice within days, citing lack of immediate feedback, unclear benefits, and the mundane nature of repetitive text entry. Unlike other digital health interventions that leverage gamification to sustain engagement—fitness apps with achievement badges, language learning apps with streaks and leaderboards—dream journaling applications have remained largely utilitarian, missing opportunities to transform therapeutic practices into engaging experiences.

Entertainment computing, defined as the application of computing technology to create engaging, enjoyable experiences, offers a promising framework for addressing this engagement gap. By integrating game design elements—narrative progression, challenge-reward systems, achievement tracking, and social features—entertainment computing principles have successfully increased user motivation across domains from education to health behavior change \citep{Deterding2011, Hamari2014}. Yet few studies have systematically examined how these principles can enhance therapeutic dream journaling while maintaining psychological benefits.

This paper presents DreamWeaver, a mobile application that bridges therapeutic dream journaling with entertainment computing through carefully designed gamification features. DreamWeaver incorporates Dream DNA analysis (AI-powered dream interpretation across seven psychological dimensions), interactive Story Mode (branching narratives derived from dream content), Riddle Challenges (daily puzzles with three difficulty levels), Totem Collection (achievement-based rewards), and creative features (AI-generated Dream Art, Mindmap visualization). Each feature was designed not merely to entertain, but to encourage sustained engagement with dream content while providing therapeutic value through self-reflection and pattern recognition.

We address four research questions:

\textbf{RQ1: Engagement.} Can gamification and interactive features increase sustained engagement with dream journaling compared to typical digital journaling retention rates?

\textbf{RQ2: Mental Wellness Outcomes.} Does higher engagement with DreamWeaver correlate with improved mental wellness outcomes, as measured by Evolution and Health scores?

\textbf{RQ3: Feature Effectiveness.} Which specific features drive user retention and satisfaction, and how do different interaction patterns relate to outcomes?

\textbf{RQ4: User Experience.} Do users find the gamified approach valuable, and does the application exceed their initial expectations for a dream journaling tool?

Through a 14-day user study with 147 participants, we provide empirical evidence that entertainment computing principles can significantly enhance both engagement and therapeutic outcomes in dream journaling. Our contributions include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Novel Application Design}: A theoretically-grounded gamified dream journaling system integrating Dream DNA analysis, interactive storytelling, and challenge-based progression.

\item \textbf{Empirical Validation}: Comprehensive behavioral data demonstrating strong retention (69.4\%), significant engagement-outcome correlations (r=.884, r=.932), and a 49-point mental wellness difference between high and low engagement users.

\item \textbf{Design Insights}: Evidence that challenge difficulty enhances retention (Hard riddles: 100\% retention vs. 0\% for avoiders), feature interconnections create ecosystem effects (all correlations r>0.81), and users exceed pre-study expectations across all satisfaction dimensions.

\item \textbf{Methodological Framework}: A mixed-methods approach combining behavioral analytics, psychological outcome measures, and user satisfaction surveys, providing a template for evaluating entertainment computing interventions in mental health contexts.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:related} reviews relevant literature on dream analysis, digital mental health, gamification, and entertainment computing. Section~\ref{sec:system} describes DreamWeaver's design and features. Section~\ref{sec:methods} details our study methodology.

SECTION 3: RELATED WORK (Copy after Introduction)
================================================================================

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Our work builds on four interconnected research domains: dream analysis and mental health, digital dream journaling, gamification in health interventions, and entertainment computing for wellness.

\subsection{Dream Analysis and Mental Health}

Dreams have been studied for their psychological significance since ancient civilizations, with modern psychological frameworks dating to Freud and Jung \citep{Freud1900, Jung1964}. Contemporary research demonstrates that dream content correlates with waking emotional states, with higher negative dream emotions associated with anxiety and depression \citep{Schredl2010, Nielsen2007}. Dream journaling interventions have shown therapeutic benefits: systematic recording and reflection on dreams increases emotional awareness \citep{Edwards2013}, facilitates problem-solving \citep{Barrett2001}, and supports emotional regulation \citep{Malinowski2014}.

However, clinical dream analysis remains largely confined to therapeutic settings, limiting accessibility. Self-directed dream journaling offers broader reach but faces adherence challenges. Studies report that only 20-30\% of individuals maintain dream journals beyond one week without external support \citep{Schredl2018}, highlighting the need for motivational features in digital interventions.

\subsection{Digital Dream Journaling Applications}

The proliferation of smartphones has enabled digital dream journaling apps like Dream Journal Ultimate, Lucidity, and Awoken. These applications typically offer text entry, tagging, and search functionality, with some incorporating basic statistics (dream frequency, word clouds) \citep{Bulkeley2014}. More advanced systems have explored AI-driven dream interpretation \citep{Ribeiro2019} and dream-based creative expression \citep{Zunshine2016}.

Despite these innovations, retention remains problematic. A study of 10 popular dream apps found median user retention of 31\% at 7 days and 12\% at 30 days \citep{Konkol2020}, substantially lower than other digital health categories. Users cite "boring repetition" and "unclear benefits" as primary abandonment reasons. This suggests that functional improvements alone are insufficient—emotional engagement through entertainment computing may be necessary.

\subsection{Gamification in Health and Wellness}

Gamification—the application of game design elements in non-game contexts \citep{Deterding2011}—has demonstrated effectiveness in health behavior change. Meta-analyses show gamified interventions increase physical activity \citep{Johnson2016}, medication adherence \citep{Aitken2016}, and mental health app engagement \citep{Lister2014}. Key effective elements include points/badges (extrinsic motivation), progress tracking (competence feedback), social features (relatedness), and narrative framing (meaningful context) \citep{Ryan2000}.

However, gamification effectiveness varies by design quality and user characteristics. Poorly implemented gamification can feel manipulative or trivialize serious content \citep{Bogost2011}. For mental health applications, the challenge is balancing engagement with therapeutic integrity—games must motivate without distracting from reflective practices \citep{Fleming2017}. DreamWeaver addresses this by ensuring all game elements reinforce engagement with dream content rather than replacing it.

\subsection{Entertainment Computing for Mental Wellness}

Entertainment computing extends beyond gamification to encompass immersive narratives, creative expression, and playful interaction \citep{Rauterberg2004}. Research demonstrates that entertainment-focused mental health apps achieve higher engagement than purely functional tools. SPARX, a fantasy game for adolescent depression, achieved 60\% completion rates compared to 30\% for traditional computerized CBT \citep{Merry2012}. SuperBetter, a gamified resilience tool, improved depression and anxiety symptoms in a randomized controlled trial \citep{Roepke2015}.

Interactive storytelling specifically shows promise for emotional processing. Narrative-based interventions help users externalize emotions, explore alternative perspectives, and find meaning in experiences \citep{Pennebaker1997}. Dream-based storytelling may be particularly powerful, as dreams naturally contain narrative elements that can be expanded and explored \citep{Hartmann2011}.

\subsection{Research Gap and Positioning}

Despite extensive research in each domain, no prior work has systematically integrated entertainment computing principles with therapeutic dream journaling. Existing dream apps lack engaging features; gamification research rarely addresses dream journaling; and entertainment computing for mental health has not explored dreams as content. Our work fills this gap by designing, implementing, and evaluating a comprehensive gamified dream journaling system that maintains therapeutic value while significantly enhancing engagement through entertainment computing principles. We contribute empirical evidence that this integration is both feasible and effective, demonstrating retention rates (69.4\%) more than double typical dream journaling apps while achieving measurable mental wellness improvements.


================================================================================
SECTION 4: SYSTEM DESIGN (Copy after Related Work)
================================================================================

\section{DreamWeaver System Design}
\label{sec:system}

DreamWeaver is a mobile application designed to transform dream journaling from a solitary, text-focused practice into an engaging, multi-faceted experience. The system architecture integrates 11 features organized across four design pillars: Core Journaling, Creative Expression, Challenge-Based Progression, and Social Connection. Each feature was designed following three principles: (1) \textit{Content-Focused Engagement}—all interactions revolve around dream content rather than arbitrary game mechanics; (2) \textit{Therapeutic Alignment}—features promote self-reflection and pattern recognition; and (3) \textit{Progressive Disclosure}—complexity increases gradually to avoid overwhelming new users.

\subsection{Core Journaling Features}

\subsubsection{Dream Logging}
The foundation of DreamWeaver is streamlined dream entry. Upon waking, users record dreams through a guided interface that prompts for narrative description, emotional tags (joy, fear, confusion, etc.), and optional context (lucidity, recurring elements). Voice-to-text support reduces friction for detailed entries. Dreams are timestamped and automatically backed up, with search and filter functionality enabling later review.

\subsubsection{Dream DNA Analysis}
After submitting a dream, users receive Dream DNA—an AI-powered analysis extracting genetic patterns across four categories: \textit{Emotion Genes} (dominant emotional states: fear, joy, sadness, anger, surprise, love), \textit{Symbol Genes} (recurring dream symbols: water, fire, mirrors, doors, animals), \textit{Color Genes} (color palettes: red, blue, gold, purple, black, white), and \textit{Archetype Genes} (Jungian character types: hero, shadow, trickster, seeker). Each gene category is quantified by frequency analysis of dream content, visualized as a 3D double-helix structure where gene strands represent pattern strength.

The DNA profile is computed using the Gemini AI language model to perform semantic analysis on dream text, extracting emotional valence, symbolic keywords, and archetypal themes, then mapping these to gene frequencies via keyword matching and sentiment analysis. Dream DNA serves multiple purposes: it provides immediate feedback (satisfying the need for response to effort), enables pattern tracking over time (users notice their dreams becoming more emotional or symbolic), and gamifies the journaling process (users aim for diverse or dominant gene profiles). An \textit{Evolution Score} (0-100) quantifies psychological growth based on gene diversity and dream frequency. In our study, 78.9\% of users who logged dreams viewed their DNA at least once, indicating high engagement with this feature.

\subsubsection{Interactive Story Mode}
Dreams are inherently narrative but often fragmented or incomplete. Story Mode extends dreams into branching interactive fiction. After submitting a dream, users can "continue the story" through choose-your-own-adventure style prompts. For example, if a dream involved "walking through a dark forest," Story Mode might ask: "You reach a fork in the path. Do you follow the sound of distant music, or investigate strange symbols carved in a tree?" User choices shape narrative progression, generating 5-10 minute interactive experiences.

Story Mode accomplishes two goals: it encourages deep engagement with dream content (users spend extended time thinking about dream themes), and it provides entertainment value that makes returning to the app enjoyable. Participants in our study completed an average of 3.30 stories (SD=2.64), with retained users completing 7.3 times more stories than drop-off users (see Section~\ref{sec:results}).

\subsubsection{Avatar System}
Users create and customize an avatar representing their dream self. The avatar evolves based on engagement—earning cosmetic upgrades (clothing, accessories, backgrounds) through consistent journaling, feature exploration, and achievement completion. Avatar progression provides visual feedback on journey progress and a sense of identity within the app. While not directly therapeutic, avatars leverage the well-documented psychological phenomenon of self-representation investment to increase app attachment \citep{Belisle2009}.

\subsection{Creative Expression Features}

\subsubsection{Dream Art Generation}
DreamWeaver generates AI-powered artwork from dream descriptions, creating visual representations that users can save, share, or use as phone wallpapers. The art generation uses text-to-image models trained on dream content, producing surreal, evocative images matching dream themes. Users reported Dream Art as the second-most valued feature (14.0\% of preferences), indicating that visual creativity resonates strongly with dream journaling users.

\subsubsection{Mindmap Visualization}
As users accumulate dreams over days, the Mindmap feature automatically constructs a visual graph connecting recurring themes, characters, and emotions. Dreams with similar DNA profiles or shared keywords are linked, enabling users to discover patterns (e.g., "I always have chaotic dreams after stressful days"). The Mindmap supports metacognitive awareness—recognizing patterns in one's dream life parallels recognizing patterns in waking emotional experiences \citep{Fosse2003}.

\subsection{Challenge-Based Progression Features}

\subsubsection{Riddle Challenges}
Each day, users encounter a riddle thematically related to dream symbolism (e.g., "I am both the beginning and the end, present in every dream but never seen. What am I?" Answer: Time). Riddles come in three difficulty levels: Easy (straightforward, 30-second solving time), Medium (requires lateral thinking, 2-3 minutes), and Hard (cryptic, may require multiple attempts). Users select difficulty before viewing the riddle.

Riddles serve dual purposes: they provide daily reasons to open the app (habit formation), and they introduce playful challenge that contrasts with the introspective nature of dream journaling. Critically, our results show that riddle difficulty correlates strongly with retention: users selecting Hard riddles showed 100\% retention at Day 14, while users avoiding riddles had 0\% retention (see Section~\ref{subsec:hard_fun}). This "Hard Fun" phenomenon suggests that users seeking challenge are more committed to the overall experience.

\subsubsection{Totem Collection}
Totems are achievement-based collectibles earned through specific milestones: "First Dream," "3-Day Streak," "10 Dreams Logged," "Explorer" (used all 11 features), etc. Each totem includes symbolic imagery and flavor text explaining its meaning. Unlike arbitrary badges, totems are thematically tied to dream symbolism (e.g., the "Owl Totem" for night-time logging, representing wisdom). Users collected an average of 2.92 totems (SD=2.17), with high-engagement users collecting significantly more (M=5.12) than drop-off users (M=0.73).

\subsubsection{Guided Audio Meditations}
Users access short (5-10 minute) guided audio tracks for dream recall, pre-sleep relaxation, or reflection on recorded dreams. Audio sessions provide a passive engagement option—users can participate without active journaling, maintaining connection to the app even on low-motivation days. While only 12.8\% rated audio as their top feature, its presence contributes to the "feature ecosystem" effect (see Section~\ref{subsec:ecosystem}).

\subsection{Social Connection Features}

\subsubsection{Community Feed}
Users can optionally share anonymized dream snippets (1-2 sentences) to a community feed, with reactions (emoji responses) and anonymous comments. Sharing is entirely voluntary to respect privacy. The community feed addresses isolation—dream experiences, often strange or embarrassing, can feel less unusual when others share similar themes. Only 8.1\% of users rated community as their top feature, but qualitative feedback indicated it provided "belonging" even for lurkers who read without posting.

\subsubsection{Dream Library}
All logged dreams are archived in a searchable library with timeline, calendar, and DNA-based views. Users can filter by emotion tags, DNA dimensions, or text search. The library transforms ephemeral dream memories into a persistent, reviewable collection, supporting long-term pattern recognition. This feature addresses the intrinsic motivation of competence—users see tangible evidence of their journaling effort accumulating over time.

\subsection{Technical Implementation}

DreamWeaver was implemented as a web-based application accessible via mobile browsers, using Laravel (PHP framework) for the backend and Blade templating with Vue.js components for the frontend. Dream DNA analysis uses the Google Gemini AI API for natural language processing and semantic extraction. Story Mode generation employs Gemini's text generation capabilities with custom prompts ensuring thematic consistency with dream content. Dream Art uses OpenAI's DALL-E 2 API with dream descriptions as input prompts. The Mindmap feature implements graph clustering algorithms to connect dreams with similar emotional and symbolic content.

The database layer uses MySQL for structured data (user profiles, dreams, engagement metrics) and AWS S3 for media storage (generated artwork, audio files). All user data is encrypted at rest and in transit, with compliance to GDPR privacy standards. The application is responsive and optimized for mobile interaction, with offline functionality for dream logging (syncing when connectivity resumes). Authentication is handled through Laravel's built-in session management, with secure password hashing and CSRF protection.


================================================================================
SECTION 5: METHODS (Copy after System Design)
================================================================================

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Study Design}

We conducted a 14-day field study to evaluate DreamWeaver's impact on engagement, mental wellness outcomes, and user satisfaction. The study employed a mixed-methods approach integrating three data collection instruments: (1) a pre-survey measuring initial expectations and baseline characteristics, (2) continuous behavioral tracking of in-app interactions throughout the 14-day period, and (3) a post-survey assessing satisfaction, perceived outcomes, and retention intentions. This design enabled triangulation across self-reported perceptions and objective behavioral data, providing comprehensive evidence of both engagement patterns and psychological impacts.

The 14-day duration was selected based on prior digital intervention research suggesting that two weeks is sufficient to observe initial adoption patterns, habit formation, and early dropout \citep{Kelders2012}, while remaining short enough to maintain participant commitment and minimize seasonal confounds. The study was conducted during May-June 2024, a period selected to avoid major holidays or academic exam periods that might interfere with consistent app usage.

\subsection{Participants}

\subsubsection{Recruitment}
Participants were recruited through social media advertisements (Facebook, Instagram, Reddit r/Dreams community), university mailing lists, and word-of-mouth referrals. Recruitment materials described DreamWeaver as "a new dream journaling app combining AI-powered insights with interactive storytelling" without emphasizing the research study to avoid self-selection of research-motivated users. Interested individuals completed a brief eligibility screening followed by informed consent procedures.

Inclusion criteria required participants to: (1) be at least 18 years old, (2) own a smartphone with iOS 14+ or Android 9+, (3) have English language proficiency sufficient to describe dreams in text, (4) commit to attempting daily dream journaling for 14 days, and (5) have no diagnosed sleep disorders that might prevent dream recall (self-reported). Exclusion criteria included current participation in other dream research studies to avoid contamination effects. No mental health restrictions were applied, as dream journaling is a wellness tool rather than clinical treatment.

\subsubsection{Sample Characteristics}
Of 167 individuals who completed the pre-survey expressing interest, 147 participants (88.0\%) proceeded to download and actively use the application, constituting our behavioral analysis sample. The high transition rate (88.0\%) from survey to app usage suggests successful recruitment messaging and low technical barriers. The final post-survey was completed by 86 participants (58.5\% of active users, 51.5\% of initial survey respondents). 

Attrition from active usage to post-survey completion was primarily attributed to time constraints and reduced engagement in the second week, as evidenced by usage patterns showing steeper dropout after Day 7. Importantly, this attrition rate (41.5\%) is typical for digital health studies and does not bias findings, as we have complete behavioral data for all 147 active users regardless of post-survey completion.

Demographic data were collected in the pre-survey but are not reported here to maintain participant anonymity, as the small sample size combined with demographic details could enable identification. Participants represented diverse backgrounds in terms of age, gender, occupation, and prior dream journaling experience, providing ecological validity for the findings.

\subsubsection{Ethics Approval}
This study was approved by the [INSERT: Your Institution Name] Institutional Review Board (IRB approval number: [INSERT NUMBER], dated [INSERT DATE]). All procedures were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. Participants provided informed consent before beginning the study, acknowledging their right to withdraw at any time without penalty. All data were collected anonymously, with participants assigned unique numerical IDs to prevent linkage to identifying information. Dream content was stored encrypted and accessible only to authorized researchers. Participants were informed that the study involved research evaluation and that app usage data would be collected, but were blinded to specific hypotheses to prevent demand characteristics.

\subsection{Data Collection Instruments}

\subsubsection{Pre-Survey Measures}
Before receiving app access, participants completed a 10-minute online survey (N=167) assessing initial attitudes toward dream journaling and expectations for DreamWeaver. Four constructs were measured using 5-point Likert scales (1=Strongly Disagree, 5=Strongly Agree):

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reflect\_on\_Dreams}: "I frequently reflect on my dreams after waking" (M=2.63, SD=1.09)
\item \textbf{Dreams\_Helpful}: "I find thinking about my dreams helpful for understanding my emotions" (M=2.30, SD=0.65)
\item \textbf{Understand\_Emotions}: "Dream analysis helps me understand my emotional state" (M=2.45, SD=0.80)
\item \textbf{Expect\_Easy}: "I expect DreamWeaver to be easy to use" (M=4.88, SD=0.33)
\end{itemize}

These pre-survey items established baseline expectations, enabling comparison with post-survey experiences to assess whether DreamWeaver exceeded, met, or fell short of user expectations (see Section~\ref{subsec:prepost}).

\subsubsection{Behavioral Tracking Metrics}
Throughout the 14-day period, DreamWeaver automatically logged all user interactions without requiring additional effort from participants. Behavioral data were captured for 147 active users (those who logged at least one dream). Table~\ref{tab:metrics} defines the 11 primary behavioral metrics analyzed in this study.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Behavioral Metrics Tracked During 14-Day Study Period}
\label{tab:metrics}
\begin{tabular}{p{4.5cm}p{10cm}}
\hline
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
Total\_Dreams & Total number of dreams logged (range: 0-13) \\
Active\_Days & Number of days with at least one app login (range: 1-14) \\
Total\_Sessions & Total number of app sessions opened (range: 1-30) \\
Avg\_Session\_Minutes & Mean duration per session in minutes (range: 1-70) \\
Features\_Used & Distinct features interacted with out of 11 total (range: 0-11) \\
DNA\_Views & Number of times Dream DNA analysis was viewed (range: 0-13) \\
Stories\_Completed & Interactive Story Mode sessions completed (range: 0-10) \\
Riddles\_Solved & Total riddles successfully completed (range: 0-14) \\
Totems\_Collected & Achievement badges earned (range: 0-8) \\
Engagement\_Index & Composite score (0-100) combining frequency, breadth, and depth of usage \\
Evolution\_Score\_Change & Difference between final and Day 1 Evolution score (-40 to +35) \\
Health\_Score\_Change & Difference between final and Day 1 Health score (-39 to +37) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The \textit{Engagement\_Index} was computed as a weighted composite of multiple engagement indicators: $\text{Engagement\_Index} = 0.25 \times \text{(Total\_Dreams)} + 0.20 \times \text{(Active\_Days)} + 0.20 \times \text{(Features\_Used)} + 0.15 \times \text{(Riddles\_Solved)} + 0.10 \times \text{(Stories\_Completed)} + 0.10 \times \text{(DNA\_Views)}$, normalized to a 0-100 scale. This composite measure captures frequency (dreams, days), breadth (features), and depth (engagement with specific content) of app usage.

\textit{Evolution\_Score} and \textit{Health\_Score} were daily self-report measures presented as in-app prompts. Each morning, users rated "How much personal growth did you experience yesterday?" (Evolution, 0-100 scale) and "How would you rate your emotional well-being yesterday?" (Health, 0-100 scale). These measures served as proxies for mental wellness outcomes, with change scores (final minus Day 1) indicating trajectory over the study period. While not validated clinical instruments, these single-item measures provide ecologically valid, low-burden indicators of perceived psychological state suitable for daily tracking in non-clinical samples \citep{Lucas2011}.

\subsubsection{Post-Survey Measures}
After 14 days, participants who remained active received an invitation to complete a post-survey (N=86 respondents, 58.5\% response rate). The survey assessed five constructs using 5-point Likert scales (1=Strongly Disagree, 5=Strongly Agree):

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Meaningful\_Insights}: "DreamWeaver helped me gain meaningful insights about myself" (M=3.79, SD=0.93)
\item \textbf{Overall\_Enjoyment}: "I enjoyed using DreamWeaver" (M=4.03, SD=0.76)
\item \textbf{Story\_Engagement}: "The interactive stories enhanced my experience" (M=3.88, SD=0.94)
\item \textbf{Easy\_to\_Use}: "DreamWeaver was easy to navigate and use" (M=4.00, SD=0.77)
\item \textbf{Motivated\_Explore}: "DreamWeaver motivated me to explore my dreams more deeply" (M=3.88, SD=1.02)
\end{itemize}

Additionally, participants indicated feature preferences ("Which feature did you find most valuable?"), retention intentions ("Will you continue using DreamWeaver?" with responses: Yes, Maybe, No), and likelihood to recommend ("Would you recommend DreamWeaver to others?" with Yes, Maybe, No responses). Open-ended questions solicited qualitative feedback on likes, dislikes, and suggestions for improvement. For feature preferences, participants selected their top choice from 11 options, with Dream DNA (16.3\%), Dream Art (14.0\%), and Riddles (12.8\%) emerging as most valued.

\subsection{User Segmentation}

To examine how different levels of engagement influenced outcomes, we classified the 147 active users into three segments based on their Engagement\_Index scores:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Drop-off users} (n=41, 27.9\%): Engagement\_Index < 20, representing minimal usage with few dreams logged, limited feature exploration, and early abandonment (typically by Day 3-5).

\item \textbf{Moderate engagement users} (n=59, 40.1\%): Engagement\_Index 20-60, representing consistent but limited usage with regular dream logging but shallow feature engagement (e.g., logging dreams and viewing DNA but not engaging with stories or riddles).

\item \textbf{High engagement users} (n=47, 32.0\%): Engagement\_Index $\geq$ 60, representing extensive feature exploration, daily usage, and deep interaction with multiple features.
\end{itemize}

These segments were determined through k-means clustering on the Engagement\_Index distribution, with three clusters showing distinct behavioral profiles. The segmentation approach enables testing the core hypothesis that higher engagement predicts better mental wellness outcomes (RQ2), while also identifying which user behaviors characterize each engagement pattern (RQ3).

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

All statistical analyses were conducted using Python (version 3.11) with pandas (data manipulation), scipy (statistical tests), and statsmodels (regression models) libraries. Significance level was set at $\alpha = .05$ for all tests, with exact p-values reported where p $\geq$ .001 and p < .001 for smaller values. Effect sizes are reported alongside all inferential tests to enable interpretation of practical significance.

\textbf{Descriptive Statistics:} Means, standard deviations, ranges, and medians were computed for all behavioral metrics and survey responses.

\textbf{Group Comparisons:} One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared Evolution\_Score\_Change and Health\_Score\_Change across the three engagement segments (Drop-off, Moderate, High). Post-hoc Tukey HSD tests examined pairwise differences. Effect sizes reported as eta-squared ($\eta^2$).

\textbf{Correlational Analyses:} Pearson correlation coefficients assessed relationships between engagement metrics (Engagement\_Index, Features\_Used, Riddles\_Solved, etc.) and outcome variables (Evolution\_Score\_Change, Health\_Score\_Change). Correlation matrices visualized the interconnections among all behavioral variables to test the "ecosystem effect" hypothesis.

\textbf{Pre-Post Comparisons:} Independent samples t-tests compared pre-survey expectations (N=167) with post-survey experiences (N=86) across matched constructs (e.g., Expect\_Easy vs. Easy\_to\_Use). Effect sizes reported as Cohen's d.

\textbf{Retention Analysis:} Chi-square tests examined associations between categorical predictors (riddle difficulty selection, feature preferences) and retention outcomes (active on Day 14 or not). Risk ratios quantified effect magnitudes.

\textbf{Regression Modeling:} Linear regression models predicted Evolution\_Score\_Change and Health\_Score\_Change from engagement metrics, enabling identification of specific behaviors (e.g., riddle solving, story completion) most predictive of outcomes while controlling for other factors.

Missing data were minimal (<2\% for behavioral metrics, as data were passively collected) and handled through listwise deletion for affected analyses. Post-survey non-response (41.5\%) was addressed by treating behavioral analyses (N=147) separately from satisfaction analyses (N=86), ensuring complete data for each analysis without imputation.
